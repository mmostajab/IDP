      abstract     = {Due to rising data sizes and growing complexity, the
                      results of modern numerical simulations are increasingly
                      difficult to understand. Thus, scientific visualization is
                      vital for an in-depth comprehension of computational fluid
                      dynamics data. Especially the use of Virtual Reality
                      methodology for an interactive exploration is gaining more
                      and more importance, as it significantly facilitates the
                      analysis of complex, three- to four-dimensional flow
                      phenomena. However, large data sizes and high computational
                      complexity limit a straightforward application of flow
                      visualization methodology for real-world datasets due to
                      violations of vital real-time constraints. This thesis aims
                      at providing means for an intuitive exploration of complex
                      flow phenomena in immersive virtual environments –
                      including large, unsteady datasets, which tend to frequently
                      exceed the memory capabilities of modern workstations. Due
                      to its high expressiveness, the main focus of this work lies
                      on interactive particle tracing. By exploiting the
                      respective capabilities of the individual components of
                      today's heterogeneous visualization environments, a level of
                      interactivity is achieved which lies beyond that of
                      contemporary approaches. The theoretical foundation of this
                      work consists of novel models for the interactive
                      exploration process and contemporary visualization
                      infrastructure, as well as an extension of the classical
                      visualization pipeline. Based on an execution frequency
                      analysis, computational tasks are distributed onto the
                      components of a heterogeneous visualization environment
                      comprising high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure
                      and dedicated rendering workstations equipped with modern
                      graphics processing units (GPUs). For interactive particle
                      tracing, this results in HPC-based data reduction, followed
                      by GPU-based computation and depiction of particle
                      trajectories, thus performing a paradigm shift regarding the
                      utilization of HPC infrastructure for interactive data
                      analysis. The building blocks of such a system include an
                      efficient method for demand-driven data reduction – in
                      this case by resampling a given unstructured grid into a
                      Cartesian grid. An efficient cell search method and
                      multi-level parallelization allow for an excellent
                      utilization of available HPC resources. In order to assess
                      the approximation quality of the resampled flow field, error
                      estimation and feedback are discussed as well. Full
                      interactivity for the actual exploration is achieved by
                      performing particle tracing on the visualization front-end
                      using the GPU. While support for flow fields given on
                      Cartesian grids is relatively straightforward, this thesis
                      presents a method for storing flow data in the form of
                      tetrahedral grids within graphics memory, thus maintaining
                      an optimized domain discretization as used in the flow
                      simulation phase. Handling time-dependent flow fields on
                      Cartesian and static tetrahedral grids adds to the
                      flexibility of the presented approaches. For an efficient
                      depiction of particle information, this work introduces
                      image-based rendering techniques for both instantaneous
                      particles and particle traces. An emphasis is put on their
                      applicability in immersive virtual environments. The
                      presented methods have been integrated into the
                      visualization framework ViSTA FlowLib. These implementations
                      have been used for a thorough evaluation via performance
                      measurements and an assessment of usability, applicability
                      and expressiveness for an interactive exploration of various
                      real-world datasets with different characteristics.},
